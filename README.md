Data and code for "This Post Is Brought To You By The National Science Foundation"

#To create visuals
Simply clone the repo and run the R script "demographic_snapshots.R"!

Comments in the code mark Parts I, II, and III. Part I creates the treemap, Part II creates the stacked area charts for the raw numbers, and Part III creates the stacked area charts, nightingale plots, and line charts for the percentages.
